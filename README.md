Today I learned 

What I've been think lately... 
What should I do? 
I gotta make a to-do list so that I can manage the challenge I've facing. 
I gotta do this and get over what I've been through. 
From now on I'm starting to do something I got've to do. 

I want to change the folder's name but how? 
maybe I better git clone and do stuffs... but I still don't get the idea of git commit.
